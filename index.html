    <h3>Shipment</h3>

    <details>
      <summary>What is the shipping time</summary>
      <p>
        Standard Shipment

        With the effect of COVID-19, free shipping and paid standard shipping will take over 30 - 45 business days on average. The 45 is the minimum shipping time, which counts from the day when you have the tracking info NOT the day you placed the order.
        We will contact you if your country cannot be reached with the free shipping. Then we will give you two options, 1) to have a paid standard shipping; 2) to have an expedited shipping. Of course, if you don't want to pay, we could refund to you within 2 business days.
        
        Expedited Shipment
        
        By default, we use FedEx for most expedited orders. With the battery items, we would ship with DHL.
        Normally, the expedited shipping will take around 17 days. Please take a note that the shipping time is an estimated time not proper shipping time. For now, NONE of delivery companies offer their shipping time guarantee service.
        
        
        If your order is over 100 USD, we highly recommend to purchase the expedited shipping. It is more safe and guaranteed.
        
        Still not receive?
        
        Since the COVID-19, the longest shipping time we encounter is over 140 days with free shipping. If you don't receive the parcel after 140 days, please feel free to contact us for a solution (refund or reshipment). NOTE - the 140-day starter is from the day you have the tracking info, NOT from the day when you place the order

      <summary>How do I purchase fast shipping</summary>
      <p>
        When you check out, you will have the option for standard shipping or expedited shipping.
Expedited shipping (fast shipping) starts from 25 USD, please try to contact us with your order number when you paid. Because we need to calculate if you need to pay extra shipping or not. Thank you for your understanding.
